**This document is updated frequently! Check back every now and then to keep up to date.**
EntWorld V6
=============
This is a subserver for [Deadpine](http://www.twitch.tv/deadpine), and thus you have to be a twitch subscriber to get whitelisted.

Welcome to Ent World! We hope you enjoy the server while you are with us! We will always use the [Ent World](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ent-world) pack on curse when we are not using a pack made by someone else.

First, Link Twitch and your Minecraft accounts!
---------------------

You only need to link Twitch. You do not need GameWisp or Beam for this server.

**[You need to link your accounts (Twitch & Minecraft) in order to be able to play on the server by clicking here.](http://www.doubledoordev.net/?p=linking)**

Second, Read the rules!
---------

- We have a strict policy.
- We reserve the right to refuse access to anyone.
- There is no uptime guarantee.
- The lifetime of the server is never known.
- The server must be stable. We will remove ANYTHING to keep things working if needed.

1. Don't be a dick.
2. Don't be a dick. Share land and work together.
3. Don't be a dick. This includes not poking around in other people's stuff.
4. Don't be a dick. You cannot claim resources. Collect it and Store it.
5. ALL automatic farms of any type must have a way to be turned off. Turn them off when you do not need them anymore.
6. Mark your buildings with a sign with your name and whoever lives there/made it. If you abandon something mark it abandon!
7. Clean up after your adventures! Don't leave behind pilars of junk. Make waypoint bases instead.
8. Asking questions is OK but we are not Wikipedia. If you would like to learn a whole mod click its name in curse and click "Website" in the top right.
9. Link nether portals properly please. Use this site to help you [http://www.mavenspun.com/games/minecraft/](http://www.mavenspun.com/games/minecraft/) 
10. Bulding portals in other dimentions other than the overworld can put you outside the border. YOU WILL DIE! Items WILL NOT be Refuned.
11. Players will be kicked after 30 minutes. Bypassing this INTENONTALY will get a 12 hour ban. No ifs, ands or butts.

Things You Need to know!
------------------------

1. The server is on a reboot timer to help reduce lag. Once a day there should be a 15 minute warning before the restart and the restart should only take a few minutes to complete.
2. If the server is down please contact someone below. [You can also ping us on the Twitch App!](https://invite.twitch.tv/ING4zR) If you have any other issues use the [issue tracker!](https://github.com/Claycorp/EntWorld/issues).
